#### The following project is a sample of Anita's kichen which she aims at making a platform to start her business. Personally, am drawing a frame work for her to start the business. It is such of great idea. Probably she may be impressed and take me out for lunch.

## <strong>Description</strong>
The frame work of this project aims to meet the user's needs in starting a personal business. The business logic is well catered for.</br>
There are different types of business out there. However, the project narrows down to kitchenology (hotel management). At the end of this session, i beliee you will be able to thank me for the great work done.</br>
## <strong>Setup/Installation Requirements</strong>
* You will be able to understand the idea of the project at first site. What am i trying to say? The project is user friendly. Therefore i encourage you to <strong>DO MORE RESEARCH</strong> just in case you will get stranded anywhere.</br>
I also encourage you to try implementing this idea in real life situation. You will have nothing to lose. This is real and working. It has worked for many people.</br>
## Known Bugs
The project focuses mainly on Hypertext Markup Language/br>
and Cascading Style Sheets. It does not use any JavaScript.
Therefore you may not be able to get a platform for taking the
records of tyour customers. That will come in later.
## Technologies Used
My project has been Supported by only Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets.
## Support and contact details
You are free to ask questions from me. I will try as much as possible to answer them.
However i don't promise that i will always get back to you.
